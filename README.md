# Variational-Fashion-Encoder
Variational Auto Encoder on Fashion MNIST

This notebook implements a variational auto encoder in tensorflow and then applies it
to fashion mnist. The implementation is inspired by hwalsuklee [github](https://github.com/hwalsuklee/tensorflow-mnist-VAE/blob/master/vae.py).

The fashion dataset can be found in zalandos repository [Zalando](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
